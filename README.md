# About Project Anime
This is a project I was assigned for the course I'm taking (KodeHode). It has to be a ASP .NET Core web server that delivers static files from the wwwroot folder.
We could choose the theme for it ourselves, so I just chose one that seemed fun.

## Where I'm at
I'm still figuring out a bit what I want to do with the project. I've been testing out some color palettes and how I want it to look.
I'm also following a playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82C6-O4XrHfrGOCPmKmwTO7M0avXyQKc) to help me with the set up and connecting it to a database.
